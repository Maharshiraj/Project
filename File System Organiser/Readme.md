Developed a File System Organiser catering to the needs of file management operations offering Help, Organise and Tree functionality as of now.
It's a feature designed to organize our files using their system attributes or meta attributes(such as different extensions) into their respective folders and remove the unorganized content which was present originally. It also provides a view of the list of content of a particular directory in the tree representation format.
Thus, File Organizer operates file organizing rules which define folder grouping hierarchy and file renaming rules.
